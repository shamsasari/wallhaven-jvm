## Wallhaven (JVM)

This is a simple Kotlin application that selects a random wallpaper from [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/) and applies it to the desktop.
Currently it only supports Windows, and was primarily written to try out the new [Foreign Function and Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/424) that's coming as part
project Panama.
